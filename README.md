# mcwrap

## Getting started

Just run "test_example1.m"

If you look in the example1 directory you will see two files defining a minimal C++ function. The important thing to realize is that reverse_it.h has some special syntax that MWRAP recognizes. All of the behind-the-scenes files are in the _mcwrap directory, where a mex .cpp file is auto-generated and compiled.
